class AlgorithmSelector:
    """
    Main basic interface for algorithm selection implementations. Note: This objects life time is longer than a single algorithm selection process on a single problem instance. It actually allows to keep and exploit meta-knowledge between multiple algorithm selection processes. In the future, and extention to save and load the internal state of an algorithm selection is planned.
    
    Intended usage
    --------------
    Inherit this interface and implement the __init__ and process methods as needed.
    """
    def __init__(self, algorithms):
        """
        Parameters
        ----------
        algorithms : COLLECTION
            a set, array or other collection holding objects that represent the algorithm to selection from. This are the objects or ids passed to the callback function in process.

    def process(self, budget, callback):
        """
        Start an algorithm selection process. This represents a single algorithm selection process on one problem instance. During this process, multiple calls to the callback function can be made to evaluate the different algorithms.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        budget : float
            time budget for the whole algorithm selection process.
        callback : FUNCTION
            function that takes a single algorithm from the algorithms collection as input and returns a score : float that indicates how well that algorithm did.
