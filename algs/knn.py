ASF-BLATS
Algorithm Selection Framework
for budget limited any-time scenarios

This file contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm selection method.

Principle:
It collects all the historical results. As soon as a new problem instance arrives, it uses the historical resutls to predict the highest score and runtime. Then it runs the algorithm with the best score/cost ratio that is predicted to finish withing the predicted runtime.

Drawbacks:
The more results are gathered, the slower the method gets, because all the historically results are stored. The slowness could be countered by structuring the search space, but the space requirement remains.
